Match Up

Evan Jacques, Trevor Ayre, Samson Stannus
=========================================

We could not find a way to host the site besides running it 
on a local server.

to run the site Make sure you have Django 1.3.1 (The mcgill 
computers on the 3rd floor do). Then go into the 'match_up' 
directory. 

run these commands:
$python manage.py syncdb
$python manage.py runserver

this should run the site at http://127.0.0.1:8000/matchup/
